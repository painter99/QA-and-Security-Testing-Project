# üîÑ Project Status Update - Temporary Pause

Dear followers and visitors,

I would like to inform you about an important update regarding this QA and security testing project.

## üìã Current Situation

After thorough analysis and self-reflection, I have decided to **temporarily pause** the active development of this project. This decision is not a step back, but rather a strategic pause to strengthen fundamental knowledge.

## üéØ Reasons for the Pause

During the project's preparation phase, I identified the need for deeper understanding of basic technologies, specifically:
- HTML fundamentals
- CSS principles and best practices
- Basic web development concepts

## üå± Plan During the Pause

In the upcoming period, I will focus on:
1. Systematic study of HTML and HTML5 specification
2. Practical exercises in CSS layouts and responsive design
3. Building solid foundations for effective web application testing

## ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Duration

The project will be paused for the time necessary to master the aforementioned basics. I expect to return to active development with strengthened knowledge that will allow me to implement the project more effectively and professionally.

## üí° What This Means for the Project

- The repository remains active
- Documentation and plans are preserved
- I will regularly update this README with my learning progress
- Upon return, I will implement the acquired knowledge into the original plan

## üì¨ Contact

During this pause, I remain open to:
- Feedback
- Suggestions for improvement
- Mentoring and advice from experienced colleagues

# Original Project Description

## Overview
This project represents a comprehensive planned journey into Quality Assurance (QA) and security testing, offering a structured 10-week approach to learning and applying key concepts in software testing. It focuses on developing practical skills in manual and automated testing of web applications with emphasis on security principles. This project is designed to demonstrate my commitment to transitioning into IT and showcase my potential to future employers.

## Background and Motivation
As a professional transitioning from a career in powder coating to information technology, this planned project represents my commitment to building a strong foundation in software testing and cybersecurity. My previous experience with precise work and problem-solving has provided me with valuable skills that I plan to apply in the IT world. This project is evidence of my commitment to continuous learning and passion for software quality and security assurance.

## Project Goals
- Gain practical experience in manual and automated web application testing
- Develop a strong foundation in security testing and integrate it into the regular testing process
- Create a portfolio demonstrating QA and security testing skills
- Maintain motivation through a gradual learning curve and achievable weekly goals
- Document the learning process and showcase my growth and adaptability to potential employers

## Technologies and Tools (Planned)
- Operating System: Fedora KDE
- Version Control: Git
- Programming: Python
- Test Automation: Playwright
- API Testing: Postman
- Performance Testing: JMeter
- Security Testing: OWASP ZAP
- Virtualization: Virtual Manager with Fedora Security Lab

## Project Structure (Planned 10 weeks)
1. Environment setup and tool installation
2. Introduction to test application (ToDoMVC)
3. Manual testing basics
4. Advanced manual testing
5. Introduction to automated testing
6. Advanced automated testing
7. Security testing basics and OWASP Top 10
8. Advanced security testing with OWASP ZAP
9. API testing and performance testing
10. Project finalization and documentation

## Methodology and Tools
In implementing this project, I plan to utilize a range of modern tools and methods to optimize the learning process and maximize efficiency:

- **Structured Planning:** I will use project management techniques to create a detailed 10-week learning plan.
- **Diverse Learning Resources:** I plan to combine online courses, official documentation, professional articles, and practical experiments.
- **Version Control and Documentation:** I will use Git for progress tracking and GitHub for sharing results and documentation.
- **AI Assistants:** I plan to use AI tools to help with content structuring, explaining complex concepts, and generating ideas for test scenarios. I will always critically evaluate and modify these inputs based on my own understanding and research.
- **Practical Testing:** I aim to actively apply learned concepts to real projects, including open-source applications.
- **Community and Feedback:** I plan to actively engage in online communities where I will share my progress and receive valuable feedback from more experienced professionals.

This multifaceted approach will enable me to learn effectively, gain deeper understanding of complex topics, and develop practical skills in QA and security testing.

## Expected Outputs
- Comprehensive test documentation including test plans, cases, and results
- Suite of automated tests created using Playwright
- Detailed security testing reports based on OWASP Top 10
- Collection of API tests in Postman and performance test results from JMeter
- GitHub repository containing all project materials
- Presentation summarizing the project, acquired skills, and unique journey
- "Learning Journal" documenting daily progress, insights gained, and reflections on the transition to IT

## Planned Skills to Develop
- Comprehensive manual and automated testing techniques
- Deep understanding of security testing principles and procedures
- Proficiency in using industry-standard tools for QA and security testing
- API testing and performance testing methodologies
- Detailed test planning and documentation
- Critical thinking and problem solving in QA and security context
- Adapting precision and attention to detail from previous career to software testing

## Future Improvements
