## Methodology and Tools

In executing this project, I plan to utilize a range of modern tools and methods to optimize the learning process and maximize efficiency:

- **Structured Planning**: I will employ project management techniques to create a detailed, 10-week learning plan.
- **Diverse Learning Resources**: I plan to combine online courses, official documentation, professional articles, and hands-on experiments.
- **Version Control and Documentation**: I will use Git for tracking progress and GitHub for sharing results and documentation.
- **AI Assistants**: I plan to utilize AI tools for help with content structuring, explaining complex concepts, and generating ideas for test scenarios. I will always critically evaluate and adjust these inputs based on my own understanding and research.
- **Practical Testing**: I aim to actively apply learned concepts to real projects, including open-source applications.
- **Community and Feedback**: I plan to actively engage in online communities where I will share my progress and gain valuable feedback from more experienced professionals.

This multifaceted approach will allow me to learn efficiently, gain a deeper understanding of complex topics, and develop practical skills in QA and security testing.

## Expected Outputs
1. Comprehensive test documentation including test plans, cases, and results
2. Suite of automated tests created using Playwright
3. Detailed security testing reports based on OWASP Top 10
4. API test collection in Postman and performance testing results from JMeter
5. GitHub repository containing all project materials
6. Presentation summarizing the project, acquired skills, and unique journey
7. "Learning journal" documenting daily progress, insights gained, and reflections on the transition to IT

## Expected Insights on Career Transition
This project will be instrumental in my transition from powder coating to IT. It will allow me to apply my existing skills in precision and problem-solving to a new domain, while also challenging me to learn new technologies and methodologies. I expect this journey to reinforce my belief in the value of continuous learning and adaptability in the tech industry.

I believe that throughout this project, I will discover numerous parallels between my previous work in powder coating and my new path in QA and security testing. The attention to detail required in ensuring a flawless coating finish should translate well to identifying subtle software bugs or security vulnerabilities. My experience in troubleshooting coating equipment should hone my analytical skills, which will be invaluable in diagnosing complex software issues.

## Project Execution Plan
To ensure the successful completion of this project and to demonstrate my progress to potential employers, I plan to:

1. Set up a public GitHub repository to track my progress and showcase my work.
2. Create weekly blog posts or video logs documenting my learning journey, challenges faced, and solutions found.
3. Develop a portfolio website to present my projects, skills, and growth in an easily digestible format for recruiters and hiring managers.
4. Actively participate in relevant online forums and communities, sharing my experiences and seeking feedback from professionals in the field.
5. Seek out mentorship opportunities or informational interviews with professionals in QA and security testing roles.

## Relevance to Career Goals
This project aligns directly with my goal of transitioning into a career in IT, specifically in the areas of QA and security testing. By undertaking this comprehensive learning journey, I aim to:

1. Develop a solid foundation in software testing principles and practices.
2. Gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and methodologies.
3. Demonstrate my ability to quickly learn and apply new technical skills.
4. Showcase my unique perspective and problem-solving abilities gained from my previous career.
